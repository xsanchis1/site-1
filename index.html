            </h2>
            <p class="content-1-content">My name is Xavier Sanchis,
                but everyone calls me Xavi. I was born in Valencia
                (Spain), on the 10th of July 2002. I have lived most 
                of my life in a small town in the province of Alicante
                called La Nucia.<br>
            
            I studied Electronic Engineering at the
                University of Exeter, where I graduated with first 
                class honours in 2023. I have alwas been 
                passionate about engineering in general, perhaps because
                of my curiosity. As a kid, understanding how everything
                around me worked, from small gadgets to more complex machines
                or systems, was something that I really enjoyed. As time
                went on and I became not so much of a kid, I started to learn
                about disciplines like electronics and programming
                where I could start to design my own devices and systems.
                For me, this opened up a new dimension in my love for
                engineering, which was the power of creating- the creative
                (and some could say artistic) aspects that this involved.
                As time has passed I have become very sensitised to
                the profound impact and beauty of a very good design, and I seek for
                examples of them everywhere, in architecture, film, cars
                and of course, electronics and software.
                
            <p class="content-1-content">I have many hobbies. I love sports- I will play any sport
                you throw at me, but I am specially fond of football and 
                tennis, both of which I started playing at a young age.
                I also love food, film, nature and anything made with love.

            <p  class="content-1-content">I am a recent electronic
                engineering graduate from the Univeristy of Exeter
                (2023). Throughout my course I have learned many disciplines
                in depth, such as analogue and digital electronics, 
                control engineering, microcontroller and 
                embedded software engineering, robotics, communications engineering,
                electromagnetics, project management and machine learning.

                Throughout my course I have obtained two Deans Commendations, which
                are awarded to the top 10% highest scoring students of each department
                every academic year. I have also obtained the Philip Booth prize,
                which is awarded to the two students with the best final year
                individual projects of the department of engineering in the University
                of Exeter. You can find a copy of my final year individual project report
                below, as well as a copy of my CV and my project portfolio.
